Django group

(1) Create a new Flask app that allows users to post about a social justice topic of your choosing. The app must:
- Make use of Bootstrap
- Make use of jQuery at least once
- Connect to a postgres database
- Have at least one view

For now, you will not need to incorporate email or user accounts/logins. You may use pre-existing code that you have.

(2) Complete the parts you know how to do and take note of the parts where you get stuck. We will spend the first 30 minutes of instruction time going over these points.
